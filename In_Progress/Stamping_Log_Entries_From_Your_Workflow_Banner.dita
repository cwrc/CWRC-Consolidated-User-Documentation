    <title>Stamping Log Entries from your Workflow Banner </title>
    <shortdesc>When uploading or editing a CWRC object it’s recommended to add a workflow stamp which would provide info about the status of the object (i.e. in progress, under review, published, etc). This is especially useful in the context of larger projects where multiple members are working on the same object / document. </shortdesc>

                        <info>The stamps define what project the entry belongs to and the status of that entry within a project. For example if this is an orlando object that you have checked for tagging, choose the orl:CFT-Checked for tagging. The stamps are unique for each project (created by project administrators). If you have a CWRC document that you have checked for tagging you would stamp it as cwrc:cre-repository item created and then add the status “In progress” or “Pending” (for more information see below).<image id="image_yth_msk_rbb" href="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A8d5329ae-79bb-4814-8b52-d930b5ca71f1/datastream/OBJ/view"></image></info>
