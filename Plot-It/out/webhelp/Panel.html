    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">General Information</h2>
      
      <p class="p"> The users can view events four ways, in the timeline, in the map, in a list view, and in a
        grid. This allows users to personalize their viewing experience when using Plot-It. <br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="reference_bd1_5ls_5r__image_zgy_xms_5r" src="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3Ad571377e-5868-4106-a120-63821a1b58ed/datastream/OBJ/view"/></div><br/></p>

      <p class="p">You can change the view of the events in the space between the timeline and the map.<br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="reference_bd1_5ls_5r__image_d51_5ms_5r" src="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A91575232-2293-4a64-bfc2-844a802e3b35/datastream/OBJ/view" height="NaN" width="NaN"/></div><br/></p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Map view</h2><p class="p">The Map view is the default view of the events in the
        timeline. Plot-It provides context to events by drawing out the geographical information of
        events and arranging them on the map. </p>
<p class="p">The map is powered by Google maps. </p>
<p class="p">Users
        can move the map around using either their cursor or the navigation button located in the
        top left corner of the map. </p>
<p class="p">Users can zoom in/out of the map three ways. The first is
        using your mouse, you can scroll in and out of the map using smart features of your mouse or
        trackpad. The second is using the existing zoom tools located on the left side of the map.
        The third is double clicking on the map ,though this option will not work when your cursor
        is over an event icon (it will just open the event). <br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="reference_bd1_5ls_5r__image_jyp_h4s_5r" src="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A06729788-e366-4ff0-8aff-2f3144b64858/datastream/OBJ/view" height="NaN" width="NaN"/></div><br/></p>
<p class="p">The map allows users to play
        around with how they view the terrain. In the top right corner, users can switch between a
        “Map” and “Satellite” view. For further personalization, users can chooses to view the
        “Terrain” when in the “Map” view, and the “Labels” when in the Satellite view.</p>
<p class="p">To
        change between these features, click on either the “Map” and “Satellite” options and then
        check (or leave unchecked) the terrain/label option that pops up.<br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="reference_bd1_5ls_5r__image_sff_q4s_5r" src="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3Acb7f894a-fff0-4c7d-8ea6-a394a1a4b951/datastream/OBJ/view" height="NaN" width="NaN"/></div><br/></p>
<p class="p">When using the map, you can switch
        to street view by dragging the person icon (located on the left side of the map) on to the
        map. This brings up a popup screen imposed over the map.</p>
<p class="p">You can then transverse the
        street. Using either your mouse, keyboard arrows, or the provided controls, you can walk
        around the streets looking for event points.</p>
<p class="p">If you try to drag the person icon over
        to the map while you are zoomed out, it will work, but you will not end up anywhere near an
        icon. The best results (for finding the specific location of events) is zooming in as much
        possible first. </p>
To quit out of the street view, click on the “X” in the top right
        corner.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> In street view, you can click on an event icon, but the metadata information
        will not come up. Instead the timeline will move to that event point and bring up the
        information in the timeline.</div>

<div class="p">To learn more information about the events, click
              on an icon. The metadata/description for that event will popup in the text box, and
              users are able to scroll through the information. When you click on one of these event
              points in the map, the timeline will move until that event is visible.  When you click
              on an event in the timeline, the map will move to the location of that event.<div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> In the map, do not use the smart feature of your mouse or trackpad
                to scroll through the event description, this will zoom in or out of the map and
                lose the popup. Users must manually scroll, in event popups, by clicking on the
                scroller available in the popup.<br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="reference_bd1_5ls_5r__image_ocq_rps_5r" src="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A51e54c02-d4d2-4a70-928a-fa0789976986/datastream/OBJ/view"/></div><br/></div>

<p class="p">When you click on an icon that
              has multiple events, the event icons will split into multiple icons. If you would like

      <p class="p">If you would not like to view timeline events in the map, you can choose to view them in a
        list. </p>

      <p class="p">When viewing the timeline events in a list, the user views the date, location, title and
        description. If the title or description is too long to fit in the preset area, then the
        user may scroll down to read more. Only the first 10 results are show on the first page, but
        at the end of the page users have the option to see all results. By clicking on this option
        all the results are loaded on the page for the user to scroll through. <br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="reference_bd1_5ls_5r__image_tgr_rz3_yr" src="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A11dac6ac-6ef1-41e4-8e20-3d4bdf686e30/datastream/OBJ/view" height="NaN" width="NaN"/></div><br/></p>
