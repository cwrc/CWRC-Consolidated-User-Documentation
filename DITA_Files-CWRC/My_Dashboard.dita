  <body>
    <p>My Dashboard is where you go to check on private messages, objects have been assigned to you, and recent workflow stamps. You can also (on the right hand side) see whoâ€™s online, the projects you belong to, your bookmarks lists, workflows reports, saved searches, and credit visualizations (coming soon). </p>
