      <title>Viewing Events</title>
      <p>To view more information about an event, click on the label or icon visible in the timeline
        or map. </p>
      <p>Events are visible as a label/title accompanied with an icon (the colour of said icons
        depend on the event type) in the timeline and as an icon in the map. To learn more
        information about the events, click on an icon in the timeline or map. The
        metadata/description for that event will appear in the text box between the timeline and the
        map. Users can then scroll through the information. When users click on an icon in the map
        the timeline will scroll so that event is highlighted. <image placement="break"

          id="image_pg1_rft_5r" align="center" scale="85"/></p>
      <p>When you click on an icon that has multiple events, a popup with a list of those events
        appear. <image placement="break"
          href="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A51e54c02-d4d2-4a70-928a-fa0789976986/datastream/OBJ/view"
          id="image_jzp_ngt_5r" align="center"/></p>
      <p>Users can also view events in a list or grid format (by changing the panel view to “List
        View” or “Grid View”). When using the grid view to look at events, the user is unable to
        read event description. <image placement="break"
          href="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A84704f93-85a6-4a57-814b-51250684e7e2/datastream/OBJ/view"
          id="image_f24_rgt_5r" align="center" scale="85"/></p>
      <p>If an event does not have a date attached to it, users cannot view that event in the
        timeline. If an event does not have a location attached to it, users cannot view that event
        in the map. To view these events, there is an option located above the map on the right
          side.<image placement="break"
          href="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A1ca66503-0400-49e2-9d0f-0a3fb1c0bec6/datastream/OBJ/view"
          id="image_hgs_wgt_5r" align="center"/></p>
      <p>To view the events that are not listed, click on “17 results” to bring up a popup of the
        missing results. You can scroll through the list of events until you see one you would like
        to look at, click on that event. This brings up a popup on the left side of the
          timeline.<image placement="break"
          href="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A73cd1e32-6d7e-4249-9444-23a8dbd50854/datastream/OBJ/view"

      <title>Metadata</title>
      <p>Each event contains metadata that informs the user about the event. This metadata includes
        a label, date, location, country, description, event type, and source information (generally
        a URL).</p>
      <p>The metadata for events serve multiple purposes. The date situates events on the timeline.
        The location plots them on the map. The event type determines what colour of icon is
        assigned to it (see below). The label and description are searchable and describe the event
        for users. Events can also be filtered by its metadata, specifically date, event type and
        country. </p> <image placement="break"
        href="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A86f3ba78-8d58-4445-9ee5-13d9700eddd9/datastream/OBJ/view"
        align="center"/>
      <p>Users can only view the event type in the grid view or by looking at the colour of the icon
        associated with each event. The event types available for this version of Plot-It are:<ul
          id="ul_c5g_ldt_5r">
          <li>Dark Blue: bibliographical</li>
          <li>Green: biographical</li>
          <li>Yellow: literary</li>
          <li>Black: political</li>
          <li>Light Blue: social</li>
          <li>White: mixed<image placement="break"
              href="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3A8656c6c3-7b4f-4798-a9b3-6a2b32a5434a/datastream/OBJ/view"
              id="image_db2_qht_5r" align="center"/></li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>If the event has a longer description, users can scroll through the popup.<note
          type="important">In the map, do not use the smart feature on your mouse or trackpad to
          scroll through the event description, this will zoom in or out of the map and lose the
          popup. Users must manually scroll, by clicking on the scroller available in the popup.
